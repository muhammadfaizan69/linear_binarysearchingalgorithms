# Search Algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental search algorithms:

Linear Search
Binary Search
The purpose of this project is to implement these classic algorithms, analyze their time complexities, and practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code. These algorithms are essential in understanding how to search through datasets efficiently, making this project an excellent way to solidify core concepts in computer science.

## How to Run the Program
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

Steps to Run the Program
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/search-algorithms.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd search-algorithms
Run the program: Ensure Python is installed, then run the following command to execute the script:

bash
Copy
python search_algorithms.py
Program Execution: The program runs a test with a predefined list and target value, performing both Linear Search and Binary Search to find the target. It will output the index of the target element or indicate that the target was not found.

Purpose of the Code
The goal of this project is to:

## Implement Linear Search: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in the list until the target is found.
## Implement Binary Search: A more efficient search algorithm for sorted lists that works by repeatedly dividing the list into halves.
Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of:

The importance of algorithmic efficiency in real-world applications.
How to implement search algorithms and test them with different datasets.
## Time Complexity
### Linear Search: O(n)
Linear Search checks each element of the list sequentially until the target is found or the list is exhausted.
In the worst case, where the target element is at the last position or doesn't exist, Linear Search needs to check all n elements, making its time complexity O(n).
### Binary Search: O(log n)
Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, significantly reducing the number of comparisons required.
For a list of n elements, Binary Search narrows down the search space in logarithmic time, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n).
Important Note: Binary Search only works on sorted data. If the list is unsorted, it will either return incorrect results or require sorting beforehand.
Worst-Case Scenario for Binary Search (Unsorted List)
If Binary Search is applied to an unsorted list, it will fail to work correctly, and its time complexity will degrade to O(n), similar to that of Linear Search. This illustrates the importance of ensuring that the list is sorted before applying Binary Search.

Code Example

# Linear Search Implementation
def linear_search(arr, target):
    """
    This function performs a linear search on the array to find the target element.
    
    :param arr: List of elements
    :param target: Element to search for
    :return: Index of the target element if found, -1 if not found
    """
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


# Binary Search Implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    This function performs binary search on a sorted array to find the target element.
    
    :param arr: Sorted list of elements
    :param target: Element to search for
    :return: Index of the target element if found, -1 if not found
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1


# Main Program Execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample Data
    data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
    target = 40
    
    # Linear Search Test
    linear_result = linear_search(data, target)
    if linear_result != -1:
        print(f"Linear Search: Target {target} found at index {linear_result}.")
    else:
        print(f"Linear Search: Target {target} not found.")
    
    # Binary Search Test
    binary_result = binary_search(data, target)
    if binary_result != -1:
        print(f"Binary Search: Target {target} found at index {binary_result}.")
    else:
        print(f"Binary Search: Target {target} not found.")
